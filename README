A simple front-end to the GeeXboX uShare UPnP media server utility.

Starts a uShare instance with the list of shared folders (started with XboX compatibility).  Created it with the primary purpose of being able to easily share my video/music files with my Xbox360.

NOTE: uShare must be installed and be accessible from the user environment as "ushare"

See: GeeXboX uShare: <http://ushare.geexbox.org/>

Requirements:
KDE4 >= 4.x

Features:
- Add folders to share.
- Start and stop the uShare instance.
