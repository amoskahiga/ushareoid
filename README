Description:
A simple front-end to the GeeXboX uShare UPnP media server utility.

Starts a uShare instance with the list of shared folders (started with XboX compatibility). Created it with the primary purpose of being able to easily share my video/music files with my Xbox360.

NOTE: uShare must be installed and be accessible from the user environment as "ushare"

See: GeeXboX uShare: <http://ushare.geexbox.org/>

Requirements:
KDE4 >= 4.x
uShare

Source
Current source available at git repository:
<http://github.com/amoskahiga/ushareoid>

Features:
- Add folders to share.
- Start and stop the uShare instance.

Installation:
Extract contents and run installation scripts:
- install_local.sh will install to the local users profile
- install_global.sh will install to the global profile and requires root privileges to install

Alternatively you can run following commands:
>mkdir build
>cd build
>cmake ../ DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.kde4
>make
>make install
>kbuildsycoca4

After this, the Plasmoid should show up in the add widgets dialog.
