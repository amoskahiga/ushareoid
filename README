Description:
A simple KDE Plasmoid front-end to the GeeXboX uShare UPnP media server utility.

Starts a uShare instance with the list of shared folders. Created it with the primary purpose of being able to easily share my video/music files with my Xbox360.

Requirements:
KDE4 >= 4.x
GeeXboX uShare: <http://ushare.geexbox.org/>

Source
Current source available at git repository:
<http://github.com/amoskahiga/ushareoid>

Features:
- Add folders to share.
- Start and stop the uShare instance.
- Set common uShares startup options/settings.

Installation:
Extract contents and run installation scripts:
- install_local.sh will install to the local users profile
- install_global.sh will install to the global profile and requires root privileges to install

Alternatively you can run following commands:
>mkdir build
>cd build
>cmake ../ DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.kde4
>make
>make install
>kbuildsycoca4

After this, the Plasmoid should show up in the add widgets dialog.
